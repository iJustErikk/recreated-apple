## Lessons learned:
- Extensibility and ambiguity in CSS makes consise code
- Sass is a tool to encourage this
- Linear-gradient can be applied to text through background-clip
- Font sets with little range in weights are limiting
- Opacity can help compensate
- Flexbox is a great positioning tool
- Using a web framework makes usage of classes much easier
